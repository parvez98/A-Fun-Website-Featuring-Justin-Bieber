 			<h2>Justin Bieber</h2>
 		</article>

 		<article>
 			<p>
 		    	Justin Drew Bieber, popularly known as JB, Biebs by his Beliebers, is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He was born on 1st March 1994 in London,Ontario,Canada. JB was raised in Stratford. He's the son of Jeremy Bieber and Patricia "Pattie" Mallette.
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				Justin attended Jeanne Sauve Catholic School and graduated from St. Michael Catholic Secondary School in 2012 with a 4.0 GPA.
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				In 2007, JB sang Ne-Yo's "<b>So Sick</b>" in a local singing competition in Stratford and won the second place. Pattie posted the video of his performance on YouTube for friends and family and continued to post Just's more performances. Slowly and gradually his profile gained popularity. At that time, Justin's current manager Scooter Braun was looking for the videos of a different artists up, but ended up clicking Bieb's video accidently. Then Scooter tracked down Justin and convinced his mother to let JB go with him as she was reluctant because Scooter was a Jew.
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				At 13, Just went to Atlanta with Scooter to record demos and soon began singing for Usher as well as was signed to Raymond Braun Media Group(RBMG) of Braun and Usher. Jusin Timberlake also wanted to sign JB but lost the battle to RBMG. Through Chris Hicks, Usher contacted L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group and signed a joint pact between the 2 music labels for Justin. After this JB moved to Atlanta with his mother to further carry on his music career. 
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				Bieb's first single was "<b>One Time</b>" which was released on radio. It reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 17 on Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum in Canada and USA and gold in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
 			<p>
 				His first bulk release was an EP "<b>My World</b>" on November 17,2009. It was certified platinum in USA and double platinum in both Canada and UK. EP's secong single "<b>One Less Lonely Girl</b>" was a huge success and peaked within top 20 in Canada and USA. It was later certified gold in USA.
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				Meanwhile, Justin was also one of the voices of the remake of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie song "<b>We Are The World</b>" on the songs 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. The opening line was sung by JB which was originally sung by Lionel Richie. He also featured in the 2010 version of K'naan's "<b>Wavin Flag</b>" and sung the closing lines.
 			</p>
            <p>
            	Next, in 2010 Justin released his first album, <b>My World 2.0</b>. The first single from the album was "<b>Baby</b>"(Baby Baby Baby ohhhhh....) which featured Ludacris and no sooner became an international hit. The single has also broken the record of the most watched video.  Two other singles from the album where "<b>Never Let You Go</b>" and "<b>U Smile</b>" which were also super hits across the globe. My World 2.0 debuted number 1 at the US Billboard 200 making him the youngest male artist to do so ever since Stevie Wonder in 1963.  
            </p>
            <p>
            	And with that a magical fandom was created which was later known as the <b>"Beliebers"</b> and the fandom's leader, our very own JB, was all set to take us on a fairy tale which was always a reality and never a fiction.
            </p>
